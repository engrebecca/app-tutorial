# An Application Tutorial

## Purpose
This is a Node.js application that uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) and [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) to manage member sign ins and sign ups at a website. Passport is used to authenticate a member's username and password. Sequelize is used to retrieve and gather member information from a database. It is also used to create new entries in the database for new member sign ups.
